# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing. Hopefully this little guide will help you
use fewer words included in this list than would otherwise be the case.

The file you probably want to change is `words.txt`.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes in your branch, commit with a clear message and push to
   GitHub.
3. Create a Pull Request targetting the master branch in this repo.

Feel free to add your name to the licence file if you'd like, although I can't
see any of this actually being copyrightable.
