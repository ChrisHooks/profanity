# Profanity

A bunch of words that may be considered offensive. Useful if your client would
like a profanity filter built into their site.

This list of words is unlikely to ever be complete, but please do follow the
guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md if you'd like to expand it.

Please don't let me know how futile you think it is to try to stop people
creating offensive usernames, forum posts, etc.
